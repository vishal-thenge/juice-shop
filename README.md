**Snyk Instructions**
1. Fork this repo to your own Github account - test
2. Import your fork into Snyk via Git
3. Clone your fork to your local system and ``cd`` yourself to that directory in terminal/command prompt
4. Download and authenticate Snyk CLI if you haven't already (e.g. install NPM, then run ``npm i snyk -g`` followed by ``snyk auth``)
5. Run ``snyk test`` to scan application dependencies and confirm the scan completes successfully
6. Run ``snyk monitor`` to monitor application dependencies in Snyk
7. Ensure you have Docker desktop running, then run ``docker build . -t juice-shop`` . This will build a container image for juice-shop
8. Run ``snyk container test juice-shop --file=Dockerfile`` to scan container image and confirm the scan completes successfully
9. Run ``snyk container monitor juice-shop --file=Dockerfile`` to monitor container dependencies in Snyk

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Running ``npm install`` on your local system is **NOT needed** and likely won't work if you're on the newest version of Node (see Node compatibility chart below)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many
other security flaws found in real-world applications!

version_ of each node.js version mentioned above! There is no guarantee
